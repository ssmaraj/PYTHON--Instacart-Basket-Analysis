Instacart Basket Analysis

Project Overview

Instacart is an online grocery store with over 3 million customer orders.
The goal of this analysis was to identify customer behavior patterns and create customer profiles to support targeted marketing strategies.

This project is part of my CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and demonstrates the use of Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for large-scale data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

Key Business Questions
	•	What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
	•	Which departments and product categories are most popular?
	•	How do customer profiles differ by age, income, and family status?
	•	What are the spending patterns across loyalty groups (new vs. returning customers)?

Tools & Technologies
	•	Python: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Excel (for validation and pivot tables)

Key Insights
	•	Order Timing: Peak orders occur on Saturdays and Sundays, especially in the late morning to early afternoon.
	•	Top Departments: Produce, dairy, and snacks are the highest in demand.
	•	Customer Segmentation:
	•	Young Single Budget Shoppers: smaller, price-sensitive baskets.
	•	Young Parents: frequent purchases of baby products, snacks, and convenience items.
	•	Midlife Professionals: higher spend on organic and premium products.
	•	Older Adults: consistent but smaller basket sizes, focused on household staples.
	•	Marketing Opportunity: Target loyalty customers with personalized promotions to increase order frequency.

Deliverables in this Repository
	•	instacart_analysis.ipynb → Jupyter notebook with Python code and analysis
	•	instacart_summary.xlsx → Excel validation & pivot tables
	•	instacart_presentation.pptx → Executive presentation of findings & recommendations

Recommendations
	1.	Create marketing campaigns targeted at weekend shoppers.
	2.	Offer promotions in popular categories (produce, dairy, snacks).
	3.	Develop loyalty rewards for returning customers.
	4.	Use customer profiles to tailor promotions (e.g., baby products for young parents, premium organic items for professionals).
